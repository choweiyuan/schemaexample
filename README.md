# XML Schema Examples

This project illustrates the usage of 2 plugins 
- maven-jaxb2-plugin to generate Java classes from XSD
- Very Simple JAXB usage of the generated classes (If it's used by other projects, simply add this jar as dependency)
- build-helper-maven-plugin to publish XSD to local repository
